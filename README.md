# Our project consists of two implementations, the de Wit implementation and our implementation. de Wit's code is run in the order of step1 -> step2 -> step3 and the output from the predicted nodules is stored as a trained model and csv file. Our implementation also outputs and saves the best trained model (based on DSC score) but does not write to file.
